Aura is a project to provide a modular and expandable programming language with emphasis on development experience.  
To provide that the language is split into multiple layers to provide faster development.

 * Language layer - Handles the parsing, lexing and interpretation to a bytecode for translation.
 * Translator layer - Translates the bytecode from the language layer and generates an executable.
 * Development layer - Interfaces for tooling and other things.
